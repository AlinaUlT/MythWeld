# ENG — The game-free core and the fifth-edition module

**Why this theme:** Every number the app shows comes from the engine, and a wrong rule gives a
wrong number with no error. This theme builds the schemas, formulas, dice, effects and the
`compute()` pipeline, with no UI: first the core, which knows no game and is tested on a made-up
system, then the fifth-edition module as its own package (ADR 004). The golden tests of SPEC §6.7
are its proof.
**SPEC:** stage 1, sections §4.1, §5, §6; ADR 004, ADR 005
**Order and status:** [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) — never repeated here.
**Theme is closed when:** every ENG row is ✅ or ❌, and the phase 1 gate named in `BACKLOG.md`
(SPEC §12 stage 1, widened by ADR 004 and ADR 005) is proved.
**Read before starting:** `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/tickets/README.md`, the SPEC sections above,
ADR 004.
**Closed tickets:** in [`docs/archive/tickets/ENG_TICKET.md`](../archive/tickets/ENG_TICKET.md), moved there
when each one closes.
